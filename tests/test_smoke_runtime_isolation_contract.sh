# Runtime-isolation contract for the smoke harness (#1696, follow-up to #1691).
#
# scripts/smoke-test.sh is the process that actually starts the product during
# a smoke run, and it retires "the account daemon" seven times through
# `daemon stop`. Its wrappers sandbox HOME/XDG/TMPDIR and CBM_CACHE_DIR, but
# only CBM_RUNTIME_DIR moves the daemon rendezvous (docs/CONFIGURATION.md), so
# without a private runtime every one of those stops lands on the operator's
# live daemon. Drive the harness with an environment-probe fixture and require
# that no product process ever receives the caller's runtime or cache.
